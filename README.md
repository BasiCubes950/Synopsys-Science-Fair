# Synopsys-Science-Fair
My code for the Synopsys Science Fair.

In the Silicon Valley Synopsys Science Fair, I compared RRT (an existing algorithm) with DR-RRT (our custom made pathfinding algorithm). We then took nimRobotics' RRT code and their maps and compared their results for distance and time.

This project includes the DR-RRT code, a modified RRT code from nimRobotics, and the 4 maps also from nimRobotics.
